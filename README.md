# Macro-Pulse-Deterministic-Financial-Sentiment-Screener
Macro-Pulse is a lightweight, non-agentic tool that analyzes real-time financial news to determine market sentiment. Unlike "black box" autonomous agents, this project uses a strict linear RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to ensure auditability, speed, and zero hallucination regarding source data.
